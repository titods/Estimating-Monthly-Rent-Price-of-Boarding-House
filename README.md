# Estimating-Monthly-Rent-Price-of-Boarding-House
This is my end-to-end Data Science project involving scrapping data from a website, performing EDA, developing regression model, and deploying the model as a web app on Streamlit. You can try the web app by click this [link](https://monthlyrentpriceestimation.streamlit.app/). The web app provides some pages about an overview page of how I manage to complete this project, Data visualization page as the interactive dashboard visualization, and the last is a deployed model which can estimate the monthly rent price of boarding house.

You can follow the notebooks that I have made in order to explore completely how I manage this project. There are 3 parts of jupyter notebook file in this project:
- [Part 1 - Web Scraping.ipynb](https://github.com/titods/Estimating-Monthly-Rent-Price-of-Boarding-House/blob/main/Part%201%20-%20Web%20Scraping.ipynb) - The part of how I scraped the data from a website.
- [Part 2 - Data Wrangling.ipynb](https://github.com/titods/Estimating-Monthly-Rent-Price-of-Boarding-House/blob/main/Part%202%20-%20Data%20Wrangling.ipynb) - The part of how I did the data cleaning and data wrangling process in order to make it more accessible and easier to analyze.
- [Part 3 - EDA and Modeling.ipynb](https://github.com/titods/Estimating-Monthly-Rent-Price-of-Boarding-House/blob/main/Part%203%20-%20EDA%20and%20Modeling.ipynb) - The part of how I performed EDA to get the insights and developed machine learning regression model.
